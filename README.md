# brackets

2-day MVP sprint to create a mobile, sport-agnostic tournament bracketing app.

# MVP Planned Feature List, Day 0:

- Enter pool of competitors, their seeds specified, and receive an organized and persistent tournament structure
- Default to a double-knockout structure, with a loser's bracket
- Scores of each match are recorded, with a default "Score" key
- When a winner is selected, they advance in the tournament
- Name and game are entered for each tournmanet and used to track it
- Multiple tournaments may be ongoing at any given time, and are selectable from the main app landing page

# Stretch Goals

- Swiss tournament option
- Round robin tournament option
- Social blast links, options to auto-blast
- Attach media to specific matches (configure whether it's contemporary with the match or after-the-fact)
- Make it look good
